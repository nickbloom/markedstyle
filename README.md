#Intro to Nick Bloom's Marked Style Guide
## Fun and pretty

This is a style guide meant for taking academic notes - it's not perfect, but it gets the job done for class notes and other random things that come up. It works best for lists under headers.

### Installation

- You can put the `markedstyle.css` file anywhere - you point to it in the Preferences of Marked.app. Go to Preferences>Style, press the `+` button, and find your file. You should probably set it as the default (under the add box).
- Fonts go in your user library (Home Folder>Library>Fonts)
    - If you can't see the Library folder, open Terminal.app and type this in:
    - `sudo chflags NOHIDDEN ~/Library` 
    - it'll ask for your admin password, and then make the Library folder visible. Then drag and drop the fonts in.
    

### Usage

- The h1 (\#) is the black heading you see at the top - title goes these
- The h2 (\##) is the gray heading under the black heading. It's for short descriptions, like what the topic of the class was that day
- The h3 (\###) is the gold heading at the top of this list
- The h4 (\####) is a gray header like you see below, nested under the h3.


#### Usage Note

- You shouldn't need more than three levels of headings, but if you do, let me know and I'll update it.
- For headers, just type in regular sentence case (Like This, for Example) -â€“ any capitalization is taken care of by the CSS.
